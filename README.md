I created an e-commerce platform using MongoDB as the primary database with Sequelize, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js for a robust and scalable solution. MongoDB efficiently stored and retrieved product information, while Express.js provided a flexible server-side framework. Angular enhanced the user interface, and Node.js ensured high performance. Additionally, I developed an alternative version of the platform using Sequelize, offering a SQL-based database option.
#### NOTE: this is not the final version, it's just a part of the project (no best practice), for the final version with a good best practice you can contact me
